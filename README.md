# ImagiCraft: DALL-E Text-to-Image Generation

ImagiCraft is a Streamlit-based application for generating images using OpenAI's DALL-E, a powerful text-to-image model. This project leverages the capabilities of DALL-E to produce high-quality images from 
textual prompts.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Utilizes the DALL-E model to generate images based on textual prompts provided by the user.
- **Rate Limiting**: Incorporates rate limiting to control the generation of images and prevent excessive API usage.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main Python script containing the Streamlit application code.
- **`background.jpg`**: Default background image for the Streamlit application.
- **`requirements.txt`**: File containing the Python dependencies required for running the application.
- **`img.png`**: Image generated using DALL-E.
